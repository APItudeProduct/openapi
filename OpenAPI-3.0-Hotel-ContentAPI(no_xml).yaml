    # APItude Hotel Content API
  
    Hotel Content API has been designed to retrieve **all the details** of the hotels available in our [Hotel Booking API](/documentation/hotels/booking-api/api-reference/). 
    
    Hotel Content API contains several methods that allow you to obtain the details of the hotels as well as list of destinations, countries and the master types that complement the hotels informatoin (like room type descriptions, accommodation type descriptions, categories descriptions...).
    
    Note that the Languages operation is connected to all the operations in which a description is returned, since we return the language code in which that description has been returned.

      description: |-
        Return the list of available destinations, zones and grouping zones. 
        
        Destinations are the highest level entities in our destination tree by which availability can be searched. Please note that destination codes are not IATA codes. It is very important to understand that our 'destination' will not always only correspond with a unique city, but usually with the main city and the area surrounding the city. 
        
        For example, the destination code NYC in the US, corresponds with the whole New York Area, so it is not limited to the city of New York, but also covers the surrounding areas, such as New Jersey and The Hamptons. Another example is BCN in Spain, which corresponds with the entire Barcelona Province; so it searches hotels located in the city of Barcelona, but also in other cities within the Province of Barcelona, such us Hospitalet de Llobregat, Terrassa and Sabadell. So when you search for availability using the destination code, you will receive results that may be located far from the main city for which you are actually searching.
        
        It is very important to check the locations that the search retrieves to avoid booking hotels in a different location than the one requested by your customers.

        **INTERNAL SERVER ERROR** - An unexpected condition was encountered. Possible causes
        
        **SYSTEM_ERROR** - These are internal server errors, please send us these errors together with the complete logs (JSON or XML requests and responses) at [apitude@hotelbeds.com]() so that our team can review them. 
        
        **PRODUCT_ERROR** - This type of error is produced due to product restrictions or due to other account set-up limitations. In all cases, the end result is that the booking cannot be confirmed. Here is a list of common product errors:
        
        * *Insufficient allotment*: This means that the user is trying to book a room which is no longer available. This may happen if the room was still available in the Availability stage but someone else has made a reservation for this room or rooms.
        * *Price has increased*: The price increase between booking steps has exceeded the allowed tolerance that was set (by default this is 2%). This is a setting to protect clients from booking a room with a higher price than expected.
        * *Contract is closed/Office or branch not active/Cannot find channel quotation*: There are problems related to the contract.
        * *Stop sales*: This means that the hotel is forbidding sales on the requested dates.
        
        **CONFIGURATION_ERROR** - This type of error is produced by configuration restrictions set-up at account level. Usually this results in the inability to perform an specific operation. Here is a list of common configuration errors:
        
        * *This apikey is not associated with a valid client*: This means that the provided apiKey belongs to an inactive client/agency. If you need information regarding the cause for this please contact our support team at [apitude@hotelbeds.com]().
